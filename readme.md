# Intro to React: Assessment

## Brief

This is a research assessment that aim to widen learner's perspective about frontend framework. React JS is the most popular framework but it is not the only popular ones. The other two popular frontend frameworks are Vue and Angular. In this research, you do not have to dive deep technically. Instead, you should try to listen to the voices out there and make your own final judgment about these frameworks. As you attempt to answer the questions in this assessment, it will guide you through a journey of research on these three popular frontend frameworks.

You are encouraged to share resources and discuss this assessment with your classmates!

## Questions

### 1. What are the considerations one should have for choosing a technology?
```
1) Availability of learning resources. React and Angular have plenty of learning materials and documentation. There is also bigger communities to ask for help.
2) Core features that are required to perform. Is it a view layer only, fully fledged or something in between.
3) Usability. Does it achieve the desire result? Or other factors such as speed and productivity?
4) Ease of integration with other libraries

```

### 2. Is React Superior? Why?

```
It depends on the features needed to be used. React build UI component which represents a view layer and if a more complete full-featured library is needed, it will be a disadvantage. 
However, React has a larger community and share of developers, more projects will using React with the ability to include reusable components.
```

### 3. How is React similar or different compared to Vue and Angular?

```
Both Vue and React uses Virtual DOM.
Vue uses HTML templates with an option to write in JSX, whereas React uses only JSX.
Vue have easy to understand syntax which do not require any prior knowledge to any languages, whereas React uses plain Javascript.
```

```
1) Angular is based on Typescript, whereas React is based on Javascript.
2) Angular is a structural framework for developing dynamic web apps, whereas React is a javascript library that allows you to build UI components.
3) Angular is based on MVC (Model View Controller) whereas React is based on Virtual DOM.
4) Angular doesnâ€™t provide adding javascript library to the source code while React allows adding javascript library to the source code.
```

### 4. Personally, what framework would you choose for yourself or your organization? Why?
```
Personally, as a beginner in software development, I would choose React due to:
1) Familiarity with Javascript
2) Easy access to learning materials and documentation
3) My projects are currently simple and not complex

I would most probably need to learn and use other types of front-end framework in the future due to the constant changing technologies.
